git-certify is a script for git that can be used to automate the publication
of proof of existence of git commits using blockchain technology.

To do so we create a special bitcoin transaction using bitcoin opcode OP_RETURN.
OP_RETURN instantly mark a transaction as unspendable. It's output can hence be
pruned from the blockchain database by nodes who need space without
compromising their database coherency. The OP_RETURN opcode also allows up to
80 bytes of data to be embedded in the transaction output. We use this space to
store the git hash and a marker ('git:') to identify the type of message.

Once the transaction is mined in a bitcoin block, it can be proved the git
commit and all commits and files that makes the branch up to the certified commit
existed at the time the block was mined.
